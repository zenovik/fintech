## Purpose

Governing principles for Merchant Pro engineering decisions.

## Responsibilities

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single source of truth | MySQL for transactional state |
| Fail closed | Auth/authz deny by default |
| Idempotent writes | Payment and checkout create paths |
| Observable | Structured logs, metrics, health |
| Modular monolith | 46 API modules, shared infra |

## Components

Angular SPA, Express API (46 modules), Worker, MySQL, Redis, Docker Compose stack.

## Dependencies

Node 20+, MySQL 8, Redis 7, SMTP for email, external payment gateway.

## Communication

HTTPS JSON REST between SPA and API; worker polls MySQL queues; Redis pub/sub not used.

## Data Flow

Request → middleware → controller → service → repository → MySQL. Async side effects enqueue rows for worker.

## Trust Boundaries

Public internet → TLS → API → private DB network. See [Trust_Boundaries.md](./Trust_Boundaries.md).

## Failure Handling

Structured `AppError` responses; worker retries with exponential backoff; health endpoints for orchestration.

## Scalability

Horizontally scale API and worker replicas; Redis locks coordinate; MySQL remains primary bottleneck.

## Limitations

Single-region deployment in rc1; no read replica requirement; polling-based queues.

## Future Evolution

Read replicas, event outbox, multi-region DR, gateway abstraction layer.

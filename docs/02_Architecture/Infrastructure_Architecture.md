## Purpose

Physical and virtual infrastructure supporting Merchant Pro.

## Responsibilities

Define technical structure, boundaries, and cross-cutting concerns for Merchant Pro v1.0.0-rc1.

## Components

Volumes: `mysql_data`, `backend_uploads`, `backend_logs`. Network: bridge `fintech-network`. Init: `init: true` on backend/worker for signal handling.

## Dependencies

Node 20+, MySQL 8, Redis 7, SMTP for email, external payment gateway.

## Communication

HTTPS JSON REST between SPA and API; worker polls MySQL queues; Redis pub/sub not used.

## Data Flow

Request → middleware → controller → service → repository → MySQL. Async side effects enqueue rows for worker.

## Trust Boundaries

Public internet → TLS → API → private DB network. See [Trust_Boundaries.md](./Trust_Boundaries.md).

## Failure Handling

Structured `AppError` responses; worker retries with exponential backoff; health endpoints for orchestration.

## Scalability

Horizontally scale API and worker replicas; Redis locks coordinate; MySQL remains primary bottleneck.

## Limitations

Single-region deployment in rc1; no read replica requirement; polling-based queues.

## Future Evolution

Read replicas, event outbox, multi-region DR, gateway abstraction layer.
